## Introduction
This project is part of the JavaScript Basics section from the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors) Foundations Course. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The first part of the project was to create the game in the console. Then after the JS was working to create a user interface.

The user interface would be designed so the user can make a choice between rock, paper, and scissor. Then the round starts when the user clicks on the button “start game.” Then display if the user won, lost, or tied the game with the results such as “You lost, paper beats rock.” Then the user clicks “next round” to continue to play.


## Motivation
I began The Odin Project’s Foundations Course to review my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. This project brought together all those skills to make a familiar game.
